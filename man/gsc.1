.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B gsc
is a command-line client for interacting with the gsc homework server.
It supports making an account, submitting and retrieving homework code,
managing partnerships, and changing your password.
.\"
.SH "OPTIONS"
.option \-q ", " \-\-quiet
Makes output quieter
.option \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Makes output more verbose
.option \-h ", " \-\-help
Prints help information
.option \-V ", " \-\-version
Prints version information
.\"
.SH "CONVENTIONS"
To use
.BR gsc ", "
it is often necessary to refer to both local files
in your shell and remote files that have been submitted to the server.
In the documentation for various commands, the syntax for referring to
files is known as a \fISPEC\fR. \fISPEC\fRs take the following forms:
.TP
\fIhello.c\fR
Refers to a local file named \fIhello.c\fR.
.TP
\fIhw2:hello.c\fR
Refers to a remote file named \fIhello.c\fR that has been submitted as
part of HW2.
.TP
\fIhw2:\fR
Refers to the entire HW2 submission.
.PP
\fISPEC\fRs may also contain wildcard patterns that match multiple
files. In particular, ``\fI*\fR'' matches any number of characters, and
``\fI?\fR'' matches exactly one character. Patterns in local \fISPEC\fRs
are expanded by the shell, but wildcards in remote \fISPEC\fR need to be
expanded by
.BR gsc ", "
which means that they need to be quoted to prevent the shell from
interpreting them. For example, to upload all \fI.c\fR files in local
directory \fIsrc/\fR to HW5, you would run
.sh gsc cp src/*.c hw5:
.PP
But to download all \fI.c\fR files from HW5 into local
directory \fIsrc/\fR, you would run
.sh gsc cp 'hw5:*.c' src/
.\"
.SH "SUBCOMMANDS"
.SS "gsc auth \fIUSERNAME\fR"
Authenticates with the homework server.
.sss Details
.PP
Before you can authenticate, an account named \fIUSERNAME\fR must
already exist. You can use \fBgsc create\fR to register an account.
.PP
After some period of time (14 days by default), your
authentication will expire and you will need to run this command again.
.PP
.SS "gsc cat \fR[\fIOPTIONS...\fR] \fIREMOTE_SPEC...\fR"
Prints the contents of the given \fIREMOTE_SPEC\fRs to the screen.
.sss Options
.option \-a ", " --all
Allows \fIREMOTE_SPEC\fRs to refer to whole homeworks; otherwise, they
must be individual files or wildcards.
.SS "gsc cp -a \fR[\fIOPTIONS\fR...]\fB hw\fIN\fB:        \fIDST_SPEC\fR"
.SS "gsc cp    \fR[\fIOPTIONS\fR...]\fB \fISRC_SPEC...\fR \fIDST_SPEC\fR"
Copies files from local to remote or remote to local.
.sss Options
.option -a ", " --all
Allows \fISRC_SPEC\fR to refer to a whole local directory or
whole remote homework. Otherwise, sources must be individual files or
wildcards.
.option -f
Forces overwriting existing local files without asking.
.option -i
Interactively asks before overwriting existing local files.
.option -n
Never overwrites existing local files.
.sss Details
.PP
The
.B "gsc cp"
command is used to upload your homework from your shell account to the
server, or to download an earlier submission back to your shell account.
.B gsc
cannot copy local to local or remote to remote. For the former, use
.BR cp (1);
for the latter, you will have to download and reupload.
.PP
In the first form, it downloads a whole remote homework into local
directory \fIDST_SPEC\fR, creating it if necessary, and attempts to
recreate the original project structure as well. In particular, it
places files into subdirectories \fIsrc\fI, \fItest\fR, and
\fIResources\fR, creating them if needed.
.PP
In the second form,
.B "gsc cp"
works like Unix
.BR cp (1).
In particular, if there is only one \fISRC_SPEC\fR, and if that one
\fISRC_SPEC\fR names just one file (as opposed to being a directory or
a wildcard that matches multiple files), then there are three
possibilities:
.IP 1. 4
If \fIDST_SPEC\fR does not exist then it is created.
.IP 2.
If \fIDST_SPEC\fR is an existing file then \fISRC_SPEC\fR replaces it.
.IP 3.
If \fIDST_SPEC\fR is an existing local directory or a remote homework
then \fISRC_SPEC\fR is copied into it.
.PP
Otherwise, there are multiple source files, which means that the
destination must be a local directory or remote homework rather than a
single file.
.PP
By default,
.B "gsc cp"
prompts before overwriting local files when downloading, but this
behavior can be overridden with the \fB\-f\fR or \fB\-n\fR option.
.sss Examples
.PP
Upload local file \fIcircle.c\fR to remote HW1:
.sh gsc cp circle.c hw1:
.PP
Upload local file \fIcircle.c\fR to remote HW1, naming it
\fIsquare.c\fR on the server:
.sh gsc cp circle.c hw1:square.c
.PP
Download file \fIcircle.c\fR from remote HW1 to current
directory:
.sh gsc cp hw1:circle.c .
.PP
Download file \fIcircle.c\fR from remote HW1 to current
directory, naming it \fIcircle.c.bak\fR locally and overwriting it if it
already exists:
.sh gsc cp -f hw1:circle.c circle.c.bak
.PP
Upload all \fI.c\fR files in the \fIsrc/\fR and \fItest/\fR
subdirectories to remote HW1:
.sh gsc cp src/*.c test/*.c hw1:
.PP
Upload all files in the \fIResources/\fR subdirectory to remote
HW1:
.sh gsc cp -a Resources hw1:
.PP
Download all files from remote HW1 whose name contains the word
``\fItest\fR'' into the local \fItest/\fR subdirectory:
.sh gsc cp 'hw1:*test*' test
.PP
Download all files from remote HW1, recreating the project
structure in a local subdirectory named ``\fIfoobar\fR'':
.sh gsc cp -a hw1: foobar
.SS "gsc create \fIUSERNAME\fR"
Creates a new account on the homework server.
.sss Details
.PP
The name of the new account will be \fIUSERNAME\fR. This \fBMUST\fR
be your Northwestern NetID (three or four letters followed by three
digits), or you will not get credit for your submissions.
.PP
The command will prompt you to enter and then confirm a password, after
which it will attempt to create an account with the homework server.
Note that the server may reject a password as too weak. Passwords are
evaluated based on the length and the number of different character
classes (uppercase letter, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation)
involved.
.SS "gsc deauth"
Logs you out from the homework server.
.SS "gsc help \fR[\fISUBCOMMAND\fR]"
Prints the help message for a particular subcommand.
.SS "gsc ls \fIREMOTE_SPEC..."
Lists files on the homework server.
.sss Details
.PP
There may be one or more \fIREMOTE_SPEC\fRs, and each may be a
whole homework, a single file, or a wildcard possibly matching multiple
files.
.PP
The results are displayed in a table with four columns:
.IP 1. 4
size (in bytes)
.IP 2.
upload time
.IP 3.
type (\fIs\fRource, \fIt\fRest, \fIc\fRonfig, \fIr\fResource, or
\fIl\fRog)
.IP 4.
name
.SS "gsc partner \fIACTION\fR \fBhw\fIN\fR \fIUSERNAME\fR"
Creates, accepts, and cancels partner requests.
.sss Details
.PP
The \fIN\fR in \fBhw\fIN\fR must be the number of a homework assignment
that allows partners. To create or accept a request, you and your
intended partner (given by \fIUSERNAME\fR) must not already have a
partner for the specified homework.
.PP
The \fIACTION\fR must be one of:
.TP 10
\fBrequest\fR
Creates a new request to partner with \fIUSERNAME\fR.
.TP
\fBaccept\fR
Accepts an existing partner request that was created by \fIUSERNAME\fR.
.TP
\fBcancel\fR
Cancels an existing partner request that was created by either you or
\fIUSERNAME\fR.
.PP
To view outstanding partner requests, use the
.B "gsc status"
subcommand.
.SS "gsc passwd"
Changes your password.
.sss Details
.PP
You must already be authenticated to change your password. If you don't
know your password, contact course staff to have it reset.
.PP
The command will prompt you to enter and then confirm a password, after
which it will attempt to change your password on the homework server.
Note that the server may reject a password as too weak. Passwords are
evaluated based on the length and the number of different character
classes (uppercase letter, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation)
involved.
.SS "gsc rm \fR[\fIOPTIONS...\fR] \fIREMOTE_SPEC..."
Deletes files on the homework server.
.sss Options
.option \-a ", " --all
Allows \fIREMOTE_SPEC\fRs to refer to whole homeworks; otherwise, they
must be individual files or wildcards.
.sss Example
.PP
Delete all \fI.log\fR files from HW1:
.sh gsc rm 'hw1:*.log'
.SS "gsc status \fR[\fBhw\fIN\fB:\fR]"
Prints general or homework-specific status information.
.sss Details
.PP
If no homework is specified then this subcommand prints a summary of
homework grades and submission status, exam grades, and outstanding
partner requests. If a particular homework is specified, then this
subcommand prints more information specific to HW\fIN\fR.
.SS "gsc whoami"
Prints the current authenticated username.
